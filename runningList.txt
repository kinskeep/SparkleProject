1. Make barcode .tsv and .txt file using sent info from Meredith/ records from extractions
	Make sure barcodes don't have _ in them
	Do dos2unix to read in from Excel
2. Download raw tar file from sequencing place
	Also transfer genome to working directory
3. Use RADscript.1_PE.py to generate job file 
4. Prep job (Preppin.job) to move raw files, unzip them, and create demultiplexed, decontam, and trimmed files 
5. Use RADscript.3_PE.py to make the alignment job
6. Use alignment job (AlignSp.job) to align to Mendax Genome
	Uses Realigner Target Creator function in GATK to identify SNP targets  
	Delete the GATK command to fix Misencoded Quality Scores
	Realign indels
7. Use call job to call SNPs that aligned to the genome
	Uses samtools extensively; filter out unmapped reads and reads with qual score <30
8. For later comparisons across populations, merge bamtools at this point
9. Continue call job to index bam with samtools and then identify SNPs with GATK
